Someone tried sabotaging our operation by "whisking” away the secret ingredient for the perfect brunsviger. All that's left on the workbench is this sticky note full of pastry-themed symbols and random letters.

Can you help us recover the secret ingredient?

# Solution
Notice that the last line of the text looks very similar to the flag.\
Carefully replace each letter with original one until the text makes sense.
